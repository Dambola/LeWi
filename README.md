## Commits Convention
### Types
- feat: When a commit add a new feature or improves an existing one.
- fix: When a commit represents a correction of a problem.
- config: When a commit add or change configurations.
- docs: When a commit add or change documentations.
- refactor: When a commit represents a refactor of the code.
- test: When a commit add or change a testing file/feature.
- revert: When a commit is a reverting operation.
- impl: When a commit is a implementation operation.

### Basic Rule
The first line of the commit message is only made by development information. Inform the commit type and a little description and explain the context of the change (example: controller, model, api, parser, sql).<br>
The optional body is followed by a blank line if it is to be used. You can describe better here the commit information.<br>
The footer is also followed by a blank line if it is to be used.<br>
The footer is used to specify or alert something important. Soo the footer must be only in upper case letters. Just use this when it is really needed.

### Commit format
```
<type>(context): <description>

[optional-body]

[optional-footer]
```
